The talk generГі an angry response from China and seems to cast uncertainty on the polГtica u.s. to Asia.This might be the first time in history that a president or president-elect, of the united States talk directly with a lГder of TaiwГЎn, an island, self-governed with the Washington rompiГі relations diplomГЎticas in 1979.In their first comments, which seemingly sought to minimize the importance of the call, the chinese minister of Foreign affairs, Wang Yi, said the sГЎbado that the contact between the lГder taiwanese and Trump was "just a pequeГ±or trick TaiwГЎn" and not creГa to change the polГtica u.s. to China, segГєn the tv network Phoenix TV of Hong Kong."The polГtica 'one China' is the cornerstone for the healthy development of relations between China and the united States, and we hope that this foundation polГtico not be affected or daГ±ado", seГ±alГі Wang segГєn was quoted.Washington has been attached to the polГtica "one China" since 1979, when pasГі your recognition diplomГЎtico of the government of TaiwГЎn the communist government in mainland China. SegГєn this, Washington recognizes Beijing as the representative, but maintains vГnculos unofficial TaiwГЎn.A press release from the team transiciГіn Trump seГ±alГі that the republican hablГі with the president in the taiwanese, who ofreciГі their congratulations."During the conversaciГіn, they seГ±alaron the nearby vГnculos econГіmicos, polГticos and security... between TaiwГЎn and the united States. Trump tambiГ©n felicitГі to Tsai for having become president of TaiwГЎn earlier this aГ±o", is added in the statement.Trump escribiГі mГЎs afternoon on Twitter: "The president of TaiwГЎn I LLAMГ“". The employer is quejГі in the social network of the reactions to the conversaciГіn: "it Is interesting to cГіmo united States sells to TaiwГЎn thousands of millions of dГіlares in military equipment but I don't deberГa accept a call from felicitaciГіn".Trump and Tsai discussed issues that affect Asia and the future of relations between Washington and TaiwГЎn, explicГі for its part, the presidential office of the island."The president (of TaiwГЎn) hopes to strengthen the relationships and bilateral contacts asГ as to establish relations of cooperaciГіn mГЎs narrow," said a press release.Tsai said ademГЎs to Trump that he hoped that the united States supports the participaciГіn of TaiwГЎn on international issues, agregГі the office, in an apparent reference to China's efforts to isolate the paГs of global institutions such as the United Nations.He said that both tambiГ©n "shared ideas and concepts" about "to promote the development econГіmico internal and strengthen the national defense" to improve the lives of the people comГєn.On the other hand, the department spokesman, Alex Huang, said that the relations of TaiwГЎn with China and the vГnculos "healthy" between TaiwГЎn and the united States can be developed in parallel. "There is No conflict (on that)," he told reporters in Taipei.The White House is enterГі of the conversaciГіn when habГa occurred, said a senior official of the government of Barack Obama, that solicitГі anonymity for the delicate relations diplomГЎticas.The embassy of China in Washington, its Foreign Ministry in Beijing and the Office of Affairs of TaiwГЎn not responded to requests for comment.The call telefГіnica Friday is the example mГЎs remarkable up to now of the way in which Trump has desdeГ±ado conventions diplomГЎticos since ganГі the elecciГіn presidential the 8 of November. Apparently, it held discussions telefГіnicas with lГderes foreigners without the orientaciГіn usual from the State Department, overseeing u.s. diplomacy."The president-elect Trump simply estГЎ reacting impulsively, trying to take calls telefГіnicas with messages felicitaciГіn of lГderes from all over the world without taking into account the implications," said Bonnie Glaser, a consultant for Asia at the Center for Studies EstratГ©meteorological and International in Washington, D. C. Glaser, said that a call asГ was "totally unprecedented" or, at least, never habГa released pГєblicamente. It is expected that Beijing will respond with a reminder to Trump the commitments the united States has done with China on TaiwГЎn, seГ±alГі.Probably Beijing tratarГЎ to identify whether these seГ±ales are an attempt by Trump to alter the polГtica that the united States has been applied since a long time ago with respect to TaiwГЎn, seГ±alГі Glaser."EsperarГЎn that this has been a false step, but I think that, in private, definitely buscarГЎn educate this incoming president and ensure that you understand the delicate nature of the matter of TaiwГЎn", seГ±alГі.During dГ©decades, the status of TaiwГЎn has been one of the issues mГЎs delicate in the relations between China and the united States. China considers the island as a part of its territory that serГЎ taken up again, to force if necessary, in case you look for the independence. For China, it is unacceptable that a lГder taiwanГ©s to be recognized as head of State.Lai informГі from Taipei, TaiwГЎn.
